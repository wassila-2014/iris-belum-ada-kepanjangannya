A THEORY OF SPREAD F BASED ON A SCATTERING SCREEN MOD. OBLIQUE RAYS
FROM THE SOUNDER ARE SCATTERED BY A SCATTERING SCREEN INTO THE F
REGION WHENCE THEY ARE REFLECTED BACK TO THE SOUNDER. FOR FREQUENCIES
APPRECIABLY HIGHER THAN THE F REGION PENETRATION FREQUENCY THERE
IS A LINEAR RELATION BETWEEN THE MINIMUM VIRTUAL HEIGHT OF THE RETURNED
SIGNAL AND THE OPERATING FREQUENCY. ALL VIRTUAL HEIGHTS ABOVE THIS
MINIMUM VALUE AND BELOW THE NORMAL VERTICAL INCIDENCE VALUE ARE POSSIBLE
THIS FACT ACCOUNTS FOR SPREAD ECHOES BEING ENCLOSED BY TWO SHARP
DEFINED BOUNDARIES. THIS HYPOTHETICAL PICTURE AGREES WITH THAT OBTAINED

ON THE FILTER PROBLEM OF THE POWER SPECTRUM ANALYZER. IN AN ANALYSER
FOR DETERMINING THE POWER SPECTRUM OF RANDOM NOISE A SIGNAL DERIVED
BY REPEATING A FINITE SAMPLE OF THE NOISE RECORD IS D HETERODYNED
WITH ANOTHER SIGNAL WHOSE FREQUENCY IS SWEPT OVER THE WHOLE SPECTRUM

THE EFFECT OF NOISE ON THE FREQUENCY STABILITY OF A LINEAR OSCILLATOR.

OF OSCILLATION IS TO REMAIN FINITE IN THE CONTINUED PRESENCE OF NOISE
THE OSCILLATING LOOP MUST HAV. SOME ATTENUATION AND FUNCTIONS LIKE
A HIGHLY REGENERATIVE AMPLIFIER WITH A LOOP GAIN VERY NEARLY UNITY.
ACCORDINGLY THE OSCILLATOR PRODUCES NOT A SINGLE FREQUENCY BUT RATHER
A NARROW BAND OF NOISE THAT CAUSES INSTABILITY IN THE MAGNITUDE AND
IN THE APPARENT FREQUENCY OF THE OUTPUT. THES INSTABILITIES ARE DISCUSSED
FOR OSCILLATORS IN WHICH ALL ELEMENTS ARE LINEAR EXCEPT FOR SOME
SLOW ACTING AMPLITUDE CONTROL. THE BANDWIDTH OF THE NOISY OSCILLATION
CAN BE PREDICTED FROM EASILY MEASURED SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS. SEVERAL
METHODS OF DEFINING THE FREQUENCY OF THE OUTPUT ARE CONSIDERED WITH

CONCENTRATION VARIATIONS AT TWO SITES. THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS
